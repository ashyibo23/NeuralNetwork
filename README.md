# NeuralNetwork
Neural Network From scratch in Python 

Currently on-going project NN from scratch in Python. The aim of this Project is to dicompose an complex topic into small pieces and easy to understand for anyone who wish to get on-board in this domains. While this project assume that we're are all beyond beginner programmers which starts slowly.

Numpy is another tool which will be using and it's a useful packages for data science in Python however building from scratch is a main objective here. 

If anyone would like to contribute on this project feel free to get in touch.
